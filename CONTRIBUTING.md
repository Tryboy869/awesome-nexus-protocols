## Proposing New Protocols

New protocols in the Nexus suite must:

1. **Solve a universal problem** - Affects most distributed systems
2. **Have no existing standard** - Not reinventing the wheel
3. **Be framework-agnostic** - Works with any tech stack
4. **Include specification** - Complete RFC-style documentation
5. **Have reference implementation** - At least one working implementation

### Proposal Process

1. Open a GitHub Discussion with:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution approach
   - Why existing solutions don't work
   - Initial specification draft
   
2. Community discussion (2-4 weeks)

3. If accepted:
   - Create detailed RFC specification
   - Implement reference version
   - Submit for inclusion in awesome list
